# Current Working Directory (or Working Directory or Current Directory)

Most operating systems have the concept of a *current directory* or
*working directory*, which allows a directory to be temporarily
designated as the current working location. The working directory may be
changed at any time.

To change the current working directory on Linux or on Windows, use the
*cd* command followed by a directory name:

```plain
cd ops102
```

To see the name of the current directory, use the command *pwd* (Print
Working Directory) on Linux or *cd* on Windows.

To change your current directory to your home directory on Linux, use
the *cd* command by itself (with no arguments).
