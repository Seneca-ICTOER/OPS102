# What is an Operating System? 

An operating system (OS) does exactly what the name states: It is
software that operates a computer system!

Not all computers have had or required an operating system. Particularly
simple computers, including the earliest models of both business
computers and microcomputers, as well as very simple embedded computers,
do not require an operating system. The computer embedded into a simple
mass-market microwave oven, for example, only ever runs one program,
does not have communications capabilities, does not multitask, and is
never updated, and therefore has no operating system.

However, virtually all contemporary computer systems, including embedded
devices, are sufficiently complex that they are equipped with an
operating system.
