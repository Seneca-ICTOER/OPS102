# What are Regular Expressions?

Regular Expressions are search patterns for \"Regular
Text\". They are used by many different tools and languages,
including the Linux `grep` command, the Windows `findstr` command,
`less`, `vi/vim`, `sed`, `awk`, `perl`, `python`, and many others.

## Why should we use Regular Expressions?

Regular Expressions (*regexp*) can be a little daunting to learn: they often look
like someone was just bashing their head against the keyboard (or, like
a cat was lying on the keyboard). But they are very powerful - a
well-written regular expression can replace many pages of code in a
programming language such as C or C++ - and so it is worth investing
some time to understand them.
