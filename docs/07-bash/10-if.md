# Conditional Logic: if / then / elif / else / fi 

Bash provides an `if` command to support conditional logic:

~~~bash
if LIST1
then
  LIST2
fi
~~~

If the command or commands in LIST1 execute successfully and return an exit status code of 0, then the commands in LIST2 are executed.

For example, you could use a `grep` command as LIST1 and an `echo` command as LIST2:

~~~bash
if grep -q "OPS102" courses.txt
then
  echo "The course code 'OPS102' was found in the file."
fi
~~~

The `if` command also supports the `else` keyword:

~~~bash
if grep -q "OPS102" courses.txt
then
  echo "The course code 'OPS102' was found in the file."
else
  echo "The course code 'OPS102' was NOT found in the file."
fi
~~~

It also supports the `elif` (else-if) keyword:

~~~bash
if grep -q "OPS102" courses.txt
then
  echo "The course code 'OPS102' was found in the file."
elif grep -q "ULI101" courses.txt
then
  echo "The course code 'ULI101' was found in the file.
else
  echo "Neither 'OPS102' nor 'ULI101' was found in the file."
fi
~~~

Putting this all together, you could have a script like this:

~~~bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a filename: " FILE

if grep -q "OPS102" "$FILE"
then
  echo "The course code 'OPS102' was found in the file $FILE."
elif grep -q "ULI101" courses.txt
then
  echo "The course code 'ULI101' was found in the file $FILE.
else
  echo "Neither 'OPS102' nor 'ULI101' was found in the file $FILE."
fi
~~~
