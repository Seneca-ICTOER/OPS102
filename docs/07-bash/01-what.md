# What is a script? 

A shell script is a computer *program* which is
*interpreted* by an operating system *shell*.

Scipts are used to automate procedures that could be manually performed
from the command line. They can potentially save a huge amount of time
by eliminating repetitive commands. For example, if you\'re going to
compile and test a program 100x, and each compilation and test cycle
requires 25 steps (commands), you\'re looking at performing 2500 steps.
It\'s much more efficient to create a script containing those 25 steps
and run it as needed \-- in fact, you can even set things up so those
commands execute automatically as soon as you save a new version of your
program.
