This can be called the exit code, status code, exit status code, or error code.

Therefore, it may be easiest to think of this as the error code, with 0 meaning no errors. Be aware that program authors can use this value as they see fit, so the status code may indicate something else, such as the number of data items processed. The special variable $? is set to the exit status code of the last command executed by the shell.

Create a text file containing shell commands. Use any text editor (nano, vi, VS Code, gnome-text-editor, eclipse, ...) to create the file. 2. Tell the operating system which shell to use. Add a &quot;shbang&quot; line to the very top of the file, containing the text: #!/usr/bin/bash The first two chacters, the **sh**arp (#) and **bang** (!) give this line its name. They are recognized by the operating system kernel as identifying a script. The remainder of this line is interpreted by the kernel as the name of the shell which is to be used to interpret the script. In this case, /usr/bin/bash is the absolute path of the bash shell. You can substitute other interpreters to write scripts in other shell dialects (such as the Z-shell, /usr/bin/zsh) or languages (such as python, /usr/bin/python). Note that there must be nothing in font of the #! characters -- no space and no blank lines. 3. Ensure that the script has appropriate permissions. The kernel requires execute [x] permission, and the shell requires read [r] permission. Set this up with the chmod command (for example,chmod u+rx scriptname). Here is a simple example script using two commands, echo and date: #!/usr/bin/bash echo &quot;The current date and time is:&quot; date Notice the presence of the shbang line. If this is save into the file named &quot;now&quot;, the permission could be set with this command: $ chmod u+rx now The script can then be executed. Normally, the current working directory is not searched, so to run the a script in the current directory, you will need to explicitly specify the directory name like this: $ ./now The current date and time is: Sat Mar 6 12:03:32 EST 2038 ","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Looping in Bash","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/OPS102/bash/loop","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"for VARIABLE in LIST​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Looping in Bash","url":"/OPS102/bash/loop#for-variable-in-list","content":" This type of loop iterates through a list of values; the VARIABLE is sequentially set to the each of the items in the list of values and the body of the loop is executed for each value.

However, accessing storage as numbered blocks is very inconvenient for computer users! In order to conveniently use this storage, it is arranged intofiles, which are named collections of bytes of arbitrary length. The organization of blocks/sectors into files is handled by afilesystem, which is a scheme for structuring data, along with the corresponding software to implement this scheme. Most filesystems track metadata about a file in addition to the file name (usually written as &quot;filename&quot;), such as the date/time of creation, the date/time of last modification, the owner or original creator of the file, and the permissions applicable to the file (for example, who is permitted to read and to change the file contents). A hierarchical filesystem introduces the concept of directories, which are special files which hold zero or more other files. The files in a directory may themselves be directories, enabling files to be nested into an arbitrary hierarchy. The master directory is called theroot directory. When graphical user interfaces were developed, the metaphor of a traditional paper-based office was introduced, and directories were called folders in this metaphor (a folder in a traditional office is a piece of card stock folded in half to group together related papers).

This is a timeline of some of the milestone events leading to some of the most prominent operating systems used today: - Before the mid-1960s: A number of different manufacturers produced various computers for business. Since these machines were expensive, and because there were many different manufacturers, a relatively small number of machines of each model were produced. Very little was standardized, and data was rarely interchanged between computers. Consequently, there were many different operating systems, each with a fairly small market. - 1964/1965 - MIT and partners begin the Multics Project. This project introduced many concepts that became common in later operating systems, including a heirarchical filesystem, multitasking, and interactive operation. This project continued through 2000. However, Multics was a fairly resource-intensive operating system and ran only on very specific hardare. - 1969 - Bell Labs decided to end their participation in the Multics project. Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson, Bell Labs employees who were familiar with the Multics project, decided to implement some of its features in a much lighter-weight operating system, which they called Unix. Unix was soon rewritten in the C language, and could be fairly easily ported to other types of computers. - 1970s - Unix continued to grow in popularity. Many computer vendors licensed it and adapted it to work with their computers; some of these variants included Xenix (Microsoft), AIX (IBM), Ultrix (Digital Equipment Corporation), HP/UX (HP), and many others. - 1976 - Microcomputers, 8-bit computers inexpensive enough to be purchased by individuals or small businesses, became widely available. Digital Research's CP/M operating system became popular on Intel- and Zilog-based microcomputers. - 1981 - IBM decided to enter the microcomputer market with the IBM PC. Needing an operating system, IBM contacted Microsoft - but their only operating system at the time was Xenix, and the IBM PC was not powerful enough to run Xenix well, so Microsoft licensed (and later purchased) a CP/M clone named 86/DOS (aka QDOS) from a local computer company (Seattle Computer Products). This operating system was used as the basis for Microsoft's DOS (disk operating system) product, named PC/DOS when marketed by IBM or MS/DOS when marketed by Microsoft. - 1983 - The IBM PC was successful in the market, due to both IBM's marketing and the fact that IBM published the technical specifications which enabled other companies to sell compatible accessories, so IBM produced more powerful models including the IBM PC/XT (1983) and PC/AT (1984). These models had much larger amounts of RAM as well as hard disks, so Microsoft needed to update DOS with new features; they did this by incorporating some features from Xenix (their Unix version), including a heirarchical filesystem. - 1984 - Richard Stallman created GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation to promote the concept of Free Software (&quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom, not free of cost). The GNU project develops its own version of most of the Unix tools and utilities, and in many cases the GNU versions of the software are better than the versions distributed with Unix. However, the GNU project does not create a kernel, so the GNU software is usually used in conjunction with a commercial Unix system. - 1984 - The X Window System is first developed at MIT to provide a ross-platform foundation for graphical user interfaces. It becomes widely used on Unix systems sold by many different vendors. - 1985 - Microsoft introduced Windows 1.0, which was used in conjuction with DOS (users had to purchase both products). Windows provided a graphical user interface and multitasking (though both were initially very limited). - 1991 - Linus Torvalds, a computer science student in Finland, wrote and released the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel, combined with software from the GNU project and other free software projects such as the X Window System, made a useful operating system (often referred to as &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; or just Linux&quot;). Many other software developers contribute to the project. - 1992 - IBM and Microsoft ended their collaboration on OS/2, an advanced operating system with a graphical user interface. IBM continued independent development of OS/2. - 1993 - Microsoft introduced Windows/NT (for &quot;New Technology&quot;), incorporating some concepts from OS/2. Unlike previous versions of Windows which required DOS, Windows/NT provided a complete (and more advanced) operating system with a GUI and did not require DOS. All future versions of Windows were based on Windows/NT. - 2001 - Apple released MacOS, a Unix-like operating system based on the &quot;Darwin&quot; kernel and incorporating some software from the GNU project. - 2007 - A consortium of developers called the Open Handset Alliance, led by Google, released the Android operating system for mobile devices (Android was originally written as for cameras!). The Android platform is based on the Linux kernel.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"GUI vs CLI: Advantages and Disadvantages","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/OPS102/Introduction-to-OS/GUI-CLI","content":"GUI vs CLI: Advantages and Disadvantages Both graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) have strengths and weaknesses, making them suited for different types of use. The visual nature of a graphical user interface makes it well-suited for creating, editing, and viewing visual media, such as photos, videos, presentations, and highly-formatted documents. A GUI is also well-suited to dense displays of visual information, such as data dashboards. However, many GUIs are not well-suited to automation, and the large amount of information in the display may consume a lot of network bandwidth if the GUI is used over a remote connection. On the other hand, a CLI is well-suited to task automation, and many tasks may require fewer steps to perform than when using a GUI. CLIs generall require much less bandwidth when used over a network, making them well-suited to remote administration tasks. To compare the data demands of the two types of user interfaces, consider the amount of information that needs to be sent to the display to update it: - A GUI on a 1920x1080 (&quot;full high definition&quot;) monitor displays about 6 megabytes of data (2 million pixels x 3 bytes per pixel) - A CLI (or TUI) on an 80x25 character terminal displays about 2 kilobytes of data (0.002 megabytes) at one time As an example of the strengths of each type of user interface, consider the task of croping, resizing, and changing the format of photographs: - A GUI immediately shows the effect of changes and allows the adjustments to be easily fine-tuned, producing exact results for a small number of photos. However, it may take many steps to perform the edits, so editing hundreds of photographs will take a very long time. - A CLI is well-suited to automation. Edits could be applied to hundreds of pictures in a few seconds, if the edits can be adequately described on the command-line. A programmer will often use both types of user interfaces in combination. For example, they may adjust a sound file using a GUI, then use a CLI to place the sound file into a particular folder or directory. This is because programmer has been writing code to access the file, and it seems intuitive to use the same text-based reference to the file to manage the file.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"What does an Operating System do?","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/OPS102/Introduction-to-OS/What-does","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"1.

The operating system manages these resources to ensure that they are used effectively, and to ensure that there are no conflicts over their use.  As requested by the user(s), or as triggered by other factors such as the time of day or operational requirements, the OS will create processes -- running instances of computer programs. Each process is allocated compute resources by being permitted to run on one or more computer cores. To run a large number of processes, the OS will switch between them, stopping one process and starting another as needed to ensure that all of the processes get a fair share of system resources (which may not always be an equal share).  The operating system will allocate the available memory to processes and to the operating system's internal operations. The OS will program the system hardware to ensure that no process can overwrite memory allocated to another process.  The OS will also allocate storage space to various files as they are created and extended, and deallocate space when those files are truncated (shortened) or deleted. The space allocated to one file will be protected from use in other files.  Display space is similarly shared; the operating system will ensure that multiple programs can each display in their own windows, but prevent them from destroying graphics being displayed by other windows.  Peripheral devices are managed in different ways according to the characteristics of the device. For example, sound output from multiple processes will be combined for simultaneous output to the speakers (or other output devices). However, when a process accesses a printer, output from that processes is collected into a document, and the documents are queued for sequential printing, because simultaneous access would result in garbled output.

Most software developers and system administrators use multiple editors for different tasks - for example, they may choose one editor for quick cnfiguration changes, another editor (or IDE) for larger development tasks, and multiple editors for different types of documentation.  Note that features intended for one editing task can be a nuscience in another context. For example, a word processor will often convert double quote characters into &quot;smart quotes&quot; (look closely at the quotation characters in this line), where the opening and closing quote characters are distinct characters. While these look great and are good for general writing, they are problematic in code and in examples that may appear in documentation, because they will be rejected by some types of software which expect straight double-quotes (such as most shells).

Remember this sequence also!: Read - Write - eXecute (r w x)  When applied to directories, these permissions are interpreted differently:  Read -- the ability to see the names of the files and subdirectories within the directory. This is also called &quot;search&quot; permission.  Write -- the ability to create/delete/rename files and subdirectories within the directory.  eXecute (access) -- the ability to access files with the directory.

If execute permission is enabled for a directory but read permission has not been enabled, the affected community cannot view a directory listing to determine filenames, but if they know the name of a file within that directory, they may still access it.  If read permission is enabled for a directory but execute permission has not been enabled, the affected community can view the names of files in a directory (but only the names, not permissions, file size, ownership, or any other information), but they will have no access to use the files in any way.  However, read and execute permission are almost always assigned to a directory together.  In order to access a file, a user must have execute permission on __all__ of the directories from the root directory to the directory containing the file. For example, on the file/home/jdoe/ops102/practice/info.txt, a user must have execute permission on all four directories (home, jdoe, ops102, practice) to access the file.

The permissions are written as a letter -- &quot;r&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, or &quot;x&quot; -- if the permission is enabled, or a dash &quot;-&quot; if the permission is disabled. Therefore, in the example above:  rw- the user who owns the file has read and write permission r-- the group that owns the file has read permission r-- others have read permission   Note that the user who owns the file is listed as root and the group that owns the file is listed as root -- these are not the same!

The umask value is a numeric mode which represents the permissions which are not permitted on new files.  The actual permission which is given to new files is a combination of two values:  - The mode requested by the software creating the file (using the open, openat, or creat system calls), except for  - The modes prohibited by the umask value.  For example, a umask value of 0022 represents the permissions----w--w- (write permission for group and other). Therefore, any new files or directories will be created without these permissions. This is the default permission on Matrix.  The umask value can be viewed or set with the umask command.  For example, the touch command requests 0666 (rw-rw-rw-) permission on new files. Here is a demo of how the umask value can change the assigned permissions:  $ umask # view the current umask 0022 $ touch testfile0022 # umask of 0022 will deny write for group and other $ ls -l testfile0022 -rw-r--r--. 1 chris chris 0 Sep 26 11:54 testfile0022 $ umask 0000 # umask of 0000 will not deny any permissions $ touch testfile0000 $ ls -l testfile0000 -rw-rw-rw-. 1 chris chris 0 Sep 26 11:54 testfile0000 $ umask 0027 # deny group write, plus all permissions for other $ touch testfile0027 $ ls -l testfile0027 -rw-r-----. 1 chris chris 0 Sep 26 11:55 testfile0027   To ensure that no one else has any access to new files and directories that you create on Matrix (unless you change the permission mode of the file after it is created), set your umask to 0077: umask 0077  Note that the umask value is specific to the process that is currently running, and it inherited by child processes. That means that if you're using multiple shells (perhaps in multiple windows), each shell's umask value is specific to that shell, and changing it will not affect the other active shells. However, any command or program that you run from that shell will inherit the umask value. You can set the default umask value for all future bash sessions by placing a umask command into your~/.bashrc file.  Warning: be extremely careful editing your~/.bashrc file, since an error may prevent you from logging in to your Matrix account. Always stay logged in to Matrix on one terminal while using a second terminal to confirm that you are able to successfully log in to the system. If you are not able to login, fix the problem using the first terminal and then re-test.

There are three additional, &quot;special&quot; permissions:  Set User ID (SUID) - when applied to an executable program file, this permission changes the effective user ID from the user executing the file to the owner of the file for the duration of the process. For example, if a user *jdoe* executes the *passwd* command (which is owned by the *root* user and has the Set User ID permission enabled), the effective user ID is temporarily changed to *root* while that command is executing. This enables the *passwd* command to change the user's password in the */etc/shadow* file, which they otherwise do not have access to.  Set Group ID (SGID) - when applied to an executable program file, this permission is similar to SUID, but it changes the effective group ID instead of the effective user ID. When applied to a directory, this causes all newly-created files and directories with that directory to be owned by the same group that owns the directory. For example, if the directory */var/www/html/* is owned by the group *website*, then any file or directory created within */var/www/html/* will automatically be owned by the group *website* instead of the group of the person creating the file.  Sticky bit (t) - when applied to a directory, any file within that directory may be renamed or deleted only by the owner of the file, by the owner of the directory, or by a privileged process (for example, *root*, the master system administrator), regardless of any other permissions that might be set. The system's temporary directoriers (*/tmp* and */var/tmp*) have this turned on.  These permissions are represented in the ls -l output as modifications of the 'x' character:  SUID changes the user\\'s x character to an s (or S if eXecute is not turned on) SGID changes the group\\'s x character to an s (or S if eXecute is not turned on) The sticky bit changes other\\'s x character to a t (or T if the eXecute is not turned on)   When using symbolic modes with chmod, the permissions are requested as follows:  - SUID is &quot;s&quot; permission in the &quot;u&quot; community  - SGID is &quot;s&quot; permission in the &quot;g&quot; community  - Sticky is &quot;t&quot; permission in the &quot;o&quot; community  When using numeric modes with chmod, these special permissions are represented as an additional octal digit to the left of the three basic octal permission digits.

This enables many useful techniques, including:  Demand Loading - Only the portion of programs which are used are loaded. Code for features that are not used is not loaded into memory. For example, in a word processor (such as LibreOffice/OpenOffice or Word), features such as table of content generation, endnotes, and watermarks are not used in many documents, and the code for those features will not be loaded in many cases.Sharing of Memory - Shared libraries (also called Dynamically Linked Libraries) may be used by many different processes. These libraries are loaded into memory only once, using demand loading, regardless of the number of processes using each library. Similarly, a program which is running in two or more processes will be loaded into memory only once, and shared between the processes. This significantly reduces memory requirements.Swap - When system memory (RAM) is approaching full utilization, the operating system may take some of the least-recently-used areas of memory and place them in storage (hard disk or solid state disk) or compress them in order to avoid running out of free memory. Areas of memory swapped out may be swapped back in if they are later required.  Due to the utilization of these techniques and others, the memory consumption of a program can be calculated in many different ways. For example:  You could add up the full size of the program, all of the shared libraries, and the data used by a process, but that would yield a large number (a pessimistic view of memory consumption). The process is likely not occupying that much memory, and terminating the process will typically release only a fraction of that memory because most of the shared libraries will still be loaded into memory and in use by other programs.You could add up just the portion of the program in memory plus the data area in memory used by a process, but this would understate the full memory utilization because it does not include the shared libraries nor the portion of the program or data which has been swapped out or which has not (yet) been demand-loaded.  Therefore resource monitoring tools may present several different statistics about memory usage for each process, or may try to present a rough approximation of the amount of total system memory which can be reasonably attributed to a process.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"CPU​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Computer Resources","url":"/OPS102/Resources_and_Processes/Resources#cpu","content":" Each CPU core is independently capable of executing programs. Most modern CPUs have multiple cores (Symmetric Multi Processing, SMP), enabling multiple programs to be executed simultaneously. Many modern CPUs can execute more than one thread on a core (Symmetric Multi Threading, SMT), meaning that they have hardware support for rapid switching between two or more processes (or, in some cases, sub-processes called threads) on one core -- so a 4-core CPU may be marketed as capable of running up to 8 tasks. However, this does not mean that 8 programs can be fully executed at once!  To use an analogy, a SMP processor is a bit like an apartment building, where each core is like an apartment and can fully accommodate a family (whether a single, couple, roommates, or parents and children), or, in the case of the CPU, fully execute a process. SMT capability is a bit like Airbnb rentals, which enable those units to be shared out quickly when they're not in use by the main occupants, or in the case of the CPU, quickly run other threads when the core (or part of the core) is not in use.  Further complicating the issue is the fact that CPUs may have multiple cores of different specifications -- some fast, power-hungry cores used for heavy tasks, and other slower, energy-efficient cores for lighter tasks. Cores may be shut down and started up by the OS as needed. For example, some Seneca lab computers have an Intel CPU with 12 cores consisting of 10 performance cores (capable of running 2 threads) and 2 efficiency cores (capable of running 1 thread). In a similar way, a Google Pixel 8 phone has 4 energy-efficient/low-performance Arm Cortex-A510 cores, 4 mid-range Cortex-A715 cores, and one high-energy-usage/very high-performance Cortex-X3 core.  In addition, current CPUs can operate at a range of speeds, and the OS and hardware work together to dynamically tune the speed to balance temperature, energy usage, and performance.  Therefore, statistics reporting the percentage of CPU capability in use by a process may report the percentage of a core's capability in use, either with or without considering SMT capabilities, or they may report the percentage of the full CPU's capability (including all cores). When cores of different specifications are part of a single CPU, it may be difficult to determine the relative ratio of performance between the different types of cores, especially as the speed of those cores is being adjusted -- and therefore utilization percentages are almost always a rough approximation.

You can use options to select which processes are displayed, as well as the output format (table, list, or comma-separated values).  2. **taskkill** - terminates a process. By default, this command attempts to get tasks to terminate in a safe manner (for example, if the program is saving a file, that operation will be completed before the program terminates). If a program does not respond to request, you can specify the /f option, which forcibly terminates the program.  You can specify the process to be terminated in one of two ways:  * By process ID, using the */PID nnn* option, which will terminate the process with the specified process ID. * By image (program or library) name, using the */IM name* option, which terminates processes with the given image name. Asterisk wildcard characters may be specified as part of the name. Names must include the extension (for example, use *taskkill /im firefox.exe* or *taskkill /im firefox** instead of *taskkill /im firefox*).   The tasklist and taskkill commands also provide a mechanism for filtering the process selection; see the online documentation for details (help tasklist or help taskkill).

You can use these commands to view and terminate processes using Powershell:  1. **get-process** - Displays a list of current processes with basic information about each. You can specify a program name as a positional argument (without the filename extension); see the online documentation for other available options.  2. **stop-process** - Terminates a process. You may specify a PID using the -ID option (stop-process -id pid) or a program name (without the filename extension) using the -NAME option (stop-process -name name).  Tip - Short Names:** Many Powershell commandlets (built-in commands) have short names. The short name for the get-processcommand is ps and the short name for the stop-processcommand is kill, which conveniently match the names of similar commands on Linux!

Processes are specified by ID:   kill PID   By default, processes are send the terminate signal (signal 15, SIGTERM). This requests that the process terminate gracefully (for example, by completing pending operations before stopping). If a program does not respond to this signal, the kill signal (signal 9, SIGKILL) may be specified; this signal tells the operating system to abruptly and forcefully terminate the process. Either of these forms is accepted:   kill -9 PID kill -KILL PID   There are many other signals that may be sent to processes; to see a list of all available signals, run the command kill -l or see the online documentation for signal(7) (by running the command: man 7 signal).
